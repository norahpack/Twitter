# Project 2 - *Twitter App*

**Twitter App** is an android app that allows a user to view their Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total
4+4+4+5

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
* [X] User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  * [X] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  * [X] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
* [X] User can ***log out of the application** by tapping on a logout button
* [X] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  * [X] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  * [X] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to Twitter
  * [X] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline
  * [X] Newly created tweet should be manually inserted into the timeline and not rely on a full refresh
* [X] User can **see a counter that displays the total number of characters remaining for tweet** that also updates the count as the user types input on the Compose tweet page
* [X] User can **pull down to refresh tweets timeline**
* [X] User can **see embedded image media within a tweet** on list or detail view.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] User is using **"Twitter branded" colors and styles**
* [X] User sees an **indeterminate progress indicator** when any background or network task is happening
* [X] User can **select "reply" from home timeline to respond to a tweet**
  * [X] User that wrote the original tweet is **automatically "@" replied in compose**
* [X] User can tap a tweet to **open a detailed tweet view**
  * [X] User can **take favorite (and unfavorite) or retweet** actions on a tweet
* [X] User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination
* [ ] Compose tweet functionality is built using modal overlay
* [X] User can **click a link within a tweet body** on tweet details view. The click will launch the web browser with relevant page opened.
* [X] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [ ] User can view following / followers list through any profile they view.
* [ ] Use the View Binding library to reduce view boilerplate.
* [ ] On the Twitter timeline, apply scrolling effects such as [hiding/showing the toolbar](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar#reacting-to-scroll) by implementing [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events).
* [ ] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] User can unretweet tweets, and buttons change backgrounds depending on whether a user likes/unlikes and retweets/unretweets a tweet
* [X] Corners on tweets and buttons are rounded 
* [X] Like and retweet counts on the detailed tweet view update when user (un)likes / (un)retweets the tweet
* [X] The app indicates when a user has previously liked or retweeted a tweet

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My main difficulties this project dealt with views in .xml files - I spent some time familiarizing myself with the different types of layouts. I also had difficulty with figuring out how to tell how to whether a click on the like button should like or unlike a tweet. I had to think about the logic behind this choice and what variables I needed to initialize and update to determine this.
